It is a challenge to predict the information about the writer without knowing about him/her. We are going to create a classifier that predicts multiple features of the author of a given text.

The corpus incorporates a total of 681,288 posts and over 140 million words - or approximately 35 posts and 7250 words per person. Each blog is presented as a separate file, the name of which indicates a blogger id# and the bloggerâ€™s self-provided gender, age, industry, and astrological sign.
